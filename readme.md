# 🍀 Varstack

A tool to manage versioning, changelogs, & more\
with a keen focus on monorepos.

`varstack` is a flexible tool built to manage 📦 versioning and 📄 changelog designed for the Node.js ecosystem. It offers a structured, automated workflow for managing releases across multiple packages, ensuring consistent version updates.

Varstack has a strong focus on monorepos 📂, making it easier to manage multiple packages within a single repo. Varstack extends its automation capabilities to any Node.js project, whether it's an application, VSCode extension, or GitHub actions, in contrast to [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets), which primarily targets npm publishing

The project is under active development 🛠️, Your contribution to this is greatly appreciated 😊.

## 🦋 Differentiation from changesets

It is primarily a fork of 🔗 [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) with few tweaks. Varstack in intend to alleviate some of the limitations of using changesets, addressing:

- [ ] Defined pre-release based on git branch.
- [ ] Extended release/publish _automation_.
- [ ] Customizable _changelog template_.
- [ ] Repository linting and structure validation.
- [ ] Updated _GitHub release_.
